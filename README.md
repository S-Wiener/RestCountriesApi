Search for countries by name, full name, or code and view them as a list of elements on an HTML page so I can find the country data I am looking for

## Getting Started

Simply run code in cmd with following command:
```
php -S localhost:3000

... then navigate to localhost:3000 and the page will load. Thanks for taking the time to view this!
